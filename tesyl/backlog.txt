Wrap Guards in () at parser?
Increment assignments
Unary expressions - minus and negate
Better tests of complex programs


Real tests - fib with while loop, function call when ready.


Tuple values - allow pair-wise computations for BinOps.

Add Operational Semantics document, and keep up to date.
Benchmark tests - Ackermann number.
Refactor and optimize code - use more rust built-in features.

Fix issue with Equals check: if (m = 0) parsed as IfExp(AssignExp) - maybe make == ?
